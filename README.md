# Douglas Miranda's experiments

Some experiments I do when coding, you may find something you like and feel free to open issues to discuss something. =]

Inside some folders you'll find some README with instructions and details.

Note: you may want to check out my [Dockerfiles](https://github.com/douglasmiranda/dockerfiles).

## Highlights

- [Docker Swarm Mode Replicated Example with Flask and Caddy](docker-swarm-replicated-example-caddy%2Bflask/) - Automatic Rollback and Zero Downtime Deployment
- [Docker Secrets to Environment Variables](docker-secrets-as-env/) - Automatically! You don't need to tell `ENV_X = parse_secret()` for every secret.
